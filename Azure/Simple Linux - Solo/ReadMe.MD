This template deploys a single Linux based VM running CentOS version 6.7, 6.8, 7.2, or 7.3.  After the VM is deployed, the template also executes a shell [script](https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-in-the-Cloud/blob/master/Azure/Simple%20Linux%20-%20Solo/custScript.sh) which would serve to configure the operating system with the proper updates, packages, & customizations.  This template is intended to show a simple example of an [infrastructure as code](https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-in-the-Cloud/blob/master/Azure/Simple%20Linux%20-%20Solo/LinuxVirtualMachine.json) deployment which can be utilized as a learning reference and/or foundation for more complex template deployment.
